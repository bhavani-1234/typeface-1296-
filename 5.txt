Step1- Check the URL you wish to crawl's XHR network section.
Step2-Identify the request-response that provides you with the desired data.
Step3-Simulate the request in your code and receive the data from the API depending on the request type (post or get), as well as the request header and payload.

Step4-Extrapolate the pertinent information you require.
